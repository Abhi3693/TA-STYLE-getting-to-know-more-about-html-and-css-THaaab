                            The Bengal tiger, also known as the Royal Bengal tiger,[3] is a tiger from a specific population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies
                            that is native to the Indian subcontinent.[4] It is threatened by poaching, loss, and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at comprising 
                            fewer than 2,500 wild individuals by 2011. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support
                            an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals.[1] India's tiger population was estimated at 1,706–1,909 individuals in 2010.[5]
                            By 2018, the population had increased to an estimated 2,603–3,346 individuals.[6] Around 300–500 tigers are estimated in Bangladesh, 220–274 
                            tigers in Nepal and 103 tigers in Bhutan.[1][7][8]
